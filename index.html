      <h2>Spirituality</h2>
      <p>
        Life is a conversation between you and the universe.  
        Every thought, every intention, every action sends a signal.  
        When you slow down, breathe, and listen, you realize the answers were always inside you.  
        Spirituality isn’t about perfection — it’s about presence.  
        It’s about remembering that you are connected to everything, and everything is connected to you.

    <!-- TRUSTING YOURSELF -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Trusting Yourself</h2>
      <p>
        You already know what to do.  
        Your intuition is not random — it’s your soul speaking in a language only you can hear.  
        Trusting yourself is the first step toward becoming yourself.  
        When you stop doubting your inner voice, you stop living for approval and start living with purpose.

    <!-- GOD & DIVINE TIMING -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>God & Divine Timing</h2>
      <p>
        God’s timing is never late.  
        The doors that are meant for you open when you’re ready to walk through them.  
        The delays, the detours, the pauses — they’re not punishment.  
        They’re preparation.  
        What’s aligned with your spirit cannot miss you, and what misses you was never aligned.

      <h2>Creating the Life You Want</h2>
      <p>
        Manifestation is not magic — it’s partnership.  
        You bring the vision, God brings the path, and your discipline brings the results.  
        When you put in the work, stay consistent, and stay aligned, your life transforms.  
        You don’t need permission.  
        You need commitment.
